# Wrangler configuration for Cloudflare Worker
# Safe defaults for local development (workers_dev). For production routing, provide
# account_id, zone_id and route via GitHub Secrets and the CI workflow which will
# generate a temporary config used for deploy.

# For production deployment you can use a generated config in CI that injects
# the following fields from GitHub Secrets (recommended):
# account_id = "<CF_ACCOUNT_ID>"
# zone_id = "<CF_ZONE_ID>"
# route = "example.com/api/*"

# NOTE: Do not store API tokens in this file. Use GitHub Secrets instead.
